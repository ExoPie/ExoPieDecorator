- connect TT in w CR using rateParam 
- connect TT in w CR using Transfer factors  

- limit asimov for one point 
- pulls Asimov
- pulls CR only 

- impact Asimov
- impact CR only 

- TFs 
- postfit: CR only
- postfit: Asimov 

- bias testing: signal injection 
- explicitly testing that your fit result is independent under certain expected operations. For example, an artifical change in the prefit top templates that is identical between regions should just be absorbed by the fit
- good ness of fit test: saturation method: https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/wiki/commonstatsmethods#goodness-of-fit-tests
